## Introduction

We have successfully used the `find` command to locate files based on their metadata. Now, for Bandit Level 7 to 8, our focus shifts from finding the *file* to finding specific *data inside* a file.

This level introduces `grep`, one of the most fundamental and widely used text-processing utilities in the Linux command-line world. 🕵️

## The Challenge: Level 7 Goal

The goal for this level is described as follows:

> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** next to the word **millionth**.

We have a large file and a keyword. Our mission is to extract the line containing that keyword.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Let's use the right tool for the job to solve this efficiently.

### Step 1: Log into `bandit7`

Use the password from the server-wide search in the previous level to SSH into the `bandit7` user.

```bash
ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
````

### Step 2: Examine the Target File

First, let's see what we're dealing with. Use `ls -lh` to list the file and its size in a human-readable format.

```bash
ls -lh
```

You will see the file `data.txt` and notice that it's quite large.

```bash
-rw-r----- 1 bandit8 bandit7 9.5M Oct 15 10:00 data.txt
```

Trying to open this file with `cat` or a text editor would flood your terminal with millions of lines, making it impossible to find the password manually.

### Step 3: The Solution - Using `grep`

The `grep` command (which stands for **G**lobal **R**egular **E**xpression **P**rint) is designed for exactly this task. It scans a file line by line and prints only the lines that contain a matching pattern.

The basic syntax is: `grep "pattern" filename`

In our case, the pattern is the word "millionth" and the filename is `data.txt`.

### Step 4: Execute the Command

Run the `grep` command with our specific pattern and file.

```bash
grep "millionth" data.txt
```

Instead of printing the whole file, `grep` will instantly filter it and show you only the single line that contains our keyword.

```bash
millionth dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
```

The password for `bandit8` is the string of text right next to the word "millionth".

## Key Concepts Learned

* **`grep` Command**: This is the main takeaway. `grep` is the go-to tool for searching for text patterns inside files. You will use it constantly in system administration and cybersecurity.
* **Text Processing**: This level highlights the importance of tools that can efficiently process large volumes of text data without having to read it all manually.
* **Pattern Matching**: `grep` finds lines that match a given *pattern*. While we used a simple word, `grep` can also handle complex patterns called regular expressions, making it incredibly powerful.

## Conclusion

Fantastic work\! You've successfully filtered a massive dataset to extract a single piece of critical information. The `grep` command is an essential part of any command-line user's toolkit.

Copy the password you found and get ready for Level 8\!
