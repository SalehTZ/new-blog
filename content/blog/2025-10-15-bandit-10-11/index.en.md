## Introduction

So far, we've located files, filtered their contents, and even extracted text from binary data. Bandit Level 10 to 11 introduces a new core concept: **data encoding**. The password is in plain sight, but it's been transformed into a different format.

This level teaches us how to recognize and reverse Base64 encoding, a common method for representing binary data as text. 🧑‍💻

***

## The Challenge: Level 10 Goal

The objective for this level is straightforward:

> The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which contains base64 encoded data.

Our mission is to decode this data to reveal the original password.

***

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Let's translate this encoded message.

### Step 1: Log into `bandit10`

Use the password you extracted from the binary file in the last level to SSH into `bandit10`.

```bash
ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
````

### Step 2: Inspect the Data

First, take a look at the contents of `data.txt`.

```bash
cat data.txt
```

You will see a long, continuous string of letters, numbers, and perhaps a `+` or `/` sign, ending with an `=` sign. This is a classic signature of Base64 encoding.

```bash

```

### Step 3: The Solution - The `base64` Command

Linux provides a dedicated utility for this task: the `base64` command. By default, it encodes data. To decode, we use the `-d` (or `--decode`) flag.

We can tell the command to decode the file directly.

### Step 4: Execute the Decode Command

Run the `base64` command with the `-d` flag on our `data.txt` file.

```bash
base64 -d data.txt
```

The command will process the encoded string and print the original, human-readable text to the terminal, which is our password.

```bash
# Example Output
The password is IF...
```

**Alternative Method (Piping):**

You can also achieve the same result by piping the output of `cat` into the `base64` command.

```bash
cat data.txt | base64 -d
```

This is a common pattern when you're working with streams of data rather than just files.

## Key Concepts Learned

1. **Base64 Encoding**: We learned that Base64 is an *encoding* scheme, not an *encryption* one. It is used to safely transmit binary data through text-only channels (like email or HTML). It is easily reversible by anyone.
2. **The `base64` Command**: This is the key tool. We learned how to use it and its most important flag, `-d`, for decoding.
3. **Recognizing Encoded Data**: You're now more familiar with what Base64-encoded text looks like, which is a valuable skill for identifying data types during a CTF or penetration test.

## Conclusion

You've successfully decoded your first piece of Base64 data\! This is a fundamental skill, as encoding is used everywhere in computing.

Save the password for `bandit11` and let's keep the momentum going\!
