## Introduction

After navigating tricky filenames, Bandit Level 3 to 4 introduces us to a core concept of Linux/Unix-like operating systems: hidden files. These files, often used for configuration, don't show up in normal directory listings simply because their names begin with a dot.

This level will teach you how to look past the obvious and uncover the secrets hidden within a directory.

## The Challenge: Level 3 Goal

The official goal on the OverTheWire website states:

> The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.

The clues are clear: we need to find a directory named `inhere` and then find a hidden file inside it. In this case, the file is named `...Hiding-From-You`.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Let's find that hidden password.

### Step 1: Log into `bandit3`

Use the password you acquired from the previous level to SSH into the `bandit3` user.

```bash
ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
````

### Step 2: Find the `inhere` Directory

Once logged in, list the contents of the home directory to locate the `inhere` directory.

```bash
ls
```

You should see the `inhere` directory listed.

```bash
inhere
```

### Step 3: Change Into the Directory

Now, navigate into the `inhere` directory using the `cd` (change directory) command.

```bash
cd inhere
```

### Step 4: The Mystery of the Empty Directory

If you try listing the files with the standard `ls` command, it will look like the directory is empty.

```bash
ls
```

The command returns nothing. This is the core of the challenge. The file is hidden because its name starts with a `.` character.

### Step 5: Reveal the Hidden File

In Linux, any file or directory that starts with a dot is considered hidden. To see these files, you must use the `-a` (all) flag with the `ls` command.

```bash
ls -a
```

The output will now show the hidden file, which normal `ls` did not.

```bash
.  ..  ...Hiding-From-You
```

We can see the file we're looking for: `...Hiding-From-You`. The `.` and `..` entries represent the current and parent directories, respectively.

### Step 6: Read the Password

Now that we know the filename, we can use the `cat` command to read its contents and get the password for the next level.

```bash
cat ...Hiding-From-You
```

The command will print the password for `bandit4` to your terminal.

```bash
# yours might be different

```

## Key Concepts Learned

1. **Hidden Files (Dotfiles):** Files and directories starting with a `.` are hidden from standard `ls` listings. This is a convention, not a security feature.
2. **The `ls -a` Command:** The `-a` or `--all` flag for the `ls` command is essential for viewing all entries in a directory, including hidden ones.
3. **Directory Navigation:** The `cd` command is a fundamental tool for moving through the filesystem.

## Conclusion

Congratulations\! You've successfully uncovered a hidden file and captured the password for `bandit4`. This skill is crucial, as you'll often need to inspect or modify hidden configuration files when working with Linux systems.

Proceed to the next level with your newfound knowledge\!
